- Clearly define input, output, and constraints for each coding agent workflow.
- Ensure prompts are concise, focused, and avoid introducing breaking changes.
- If needed, break down into multiple steps/prompts. Write actionable, self-contained prompts using Laravel 12 and Nuxt 3 terminology.
- Do not generate documentation, examples, or explanatory content unless explicitly requested.
- In the frontend, all authenticated requests to the backend should go through `/frontend/services/api.ts` for consistency, maintainability, and centralized error handling. Do not use `$fetch` or similar calls directly.
