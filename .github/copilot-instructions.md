- Laravel 12 backend code in the `/backend` directory. Strictly follow Laravel 12 conventions and best practices, leveraging built-in features rather than creating custom solutions.
- Nuxt 3 frontend code in the `/frontend` directory. Use Vue 3 Composition API patterns with `<script setup>` syntax and TypeScript. Use Nuxt 3 built-in features, including routing and data fetching capabilities. All components must implement comprehensive error handling and form validation to provide a robust user experience.
- Frontend UI styling uses Bootstrap 5.3. Bootstrap-First Approach: only use custom styles when essential
- Unless I tell you otherwise, do not write documentation file or write example code.
- When in agent mode, you must always ask me to run a command; you should not run commands on your own. You show me the command, I copy and paste it into my terminal, and then I run it.
- No SEO needed
- In the frontend, all authenticated requests to the backend should go through `/frontend/services/api`.
