## Available Resources

This endpoint structure applies to all auto-generated resources in the BOS system:

- **Users** (`DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}`) - Delete user accounts
- **Products** (`DELETE /api/v1/products/{id}`) - Delete products
- **Estimates** (`DELETE /api/v1/estimates/{id}`) - Delete business estimates
- **Test Models** (`DELETE /api/v1/test-models/{id}`) - Delete test models

## Validation & Business Rules

- The `id` must be provided in the URL path and be a valid format
- Non-existent IDs return `404 Not Found` response
- Operations may check for dependencies before deletion
- Related resources are handled appropriately (cascade or dependency checks)
- All deletion operations are logged for audit trails
- Some resources may implement "soft delete" instead of permanent deletion

- [Products Resource](resources/products.md)
- [Estimates Resource](resources/estimates.md)
