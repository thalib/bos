## Improved Directory Layout Options for `design/`
Below are several recommended directory structures for the `design/` folder. Each option is designed to improve clarity, maintainability, and scalability for documentation, specifications, and design artifacts.
---
### Option 1: Domain-Driven Structure
- api/
  - best-practices.md
  - endpoints/
  - resources/
- app/
  - components/
  - pages/
  - services/
  - stores/
  - utils/
- rules/
  - api.md
  - app.md
- templates/
  - frontend-component.md
  - frontend-page.md
- README.md

**Rationale:**
Organizes by domain (api, app, rules, templates), making it easy to locate related documents and specifications.

---

### Option 2: Artifact-Type Structure

- requirements/
  - api.md
  - app.md
- architecture/
  - diagrams/
  - decisions.md
- specifications/
  - api/
  - app/
- templates/
- best-practices.md
- README.md

**Rationale:**
Groups files by artifact type (requirements, architecture, specifications), supporting clear separation of concerns and easier onboarding.

---

### Option 3: Layered Structure

- docs/
  - overview.md
  - glossary.md
- backend/
  - api/
  - models.md
  - rules.md
- frontend/
  - components.md
  - pages.md
  - rules.md
- shared/
  - templates/
  - best-practices.md
- README.md

**Rationale:**
Separates backend, frontend, and shared design assets, with a top-level docs section for general documentation.

---

### Option 4: Minimalist Structure

- api/
- app/
- rules.md
- templates.md
- README.md

**Rationale:**
Keeps the structure simple and flat, suitable for smaller projects or teams preferring minimal hierarchy.

---

**Selection Guidance:**
Choose the structure that best fits your team's workflow, project scale, and documentation needs. Each option is designed for clarity, maintainability, and ease of navigation.
