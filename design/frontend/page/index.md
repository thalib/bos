# `index.vue` Design Specification

The `index.vue` file serves as the entry point for the application's login page. It leverages the `CommonLogin` component to provide a unified and consistent login interface.

**File Location:** `frontend/app/pages/index.vue`

## Page Structure

```html
<template>
  <CommonLogin />
</template>
```

The `index.vue` file acts as a container that includes the `CommonLogin` component, which handles all the core functionality and logic for the login process. For more details, refer to the `design/app/components/Common/Login.md` file.
